# EC2 Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔴 Issue: Connection Timeout (ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT)

If you're getting `ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT` when accessing `http://52.66.236.157`, follow these steps:

---

## ✅ Step 1: Check EC2 Security Group (MOST COMMON ISSUE)

### Your EC2 IP: `52.66.236.157`

**The security group must allow inbound traffic on these ports:**

1. **Go to AWS Console**:
   - EC2 Dashboard → Instances
   - Select your instance
   - Click "Security" tab
   - Click on Security Group name

2. **Add Inbound Rules**:
   - Click "Edit inbound rules"
   - Add these rules:

   | Type | Protocol | Port Range | Source | Description |
   |------|----------|------------|--------|-------------|
   | HTTP | TCP | 80 | 0.0.0.0/0 | Allow HTTP traffic |
   | HTTPS | TCP | 443 | 0.0.0.0/0 | Allow HTTPS traffic |
   | Custom TCP | TCP | 5000 | 0.0.0.0/0 | Backend API (optional) |
   | SSH | TCP | 22 | Your IP | SSH access (already set) |

3. **Save rules**

---

## ✅ Step 2: Verify Deployment Workflow Ran

1. **Check GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/Shubham96681/hope_physician/actions
   - Look for "Deploy to EC2" workflow
   - Check if it completed successfully

2. **If workflow didn't run**:
   - The "Full Stack CI/CD" workflow only tests, it doesn't deploy
   - The "Deploy to EC2" workflow should run after pushing to master
   - Check if it's in the workflow list

---

## ✅ Step 3: SSH into EC2 and Check Services

```bash
# SSH into your EC2 instance
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@52.66.236.157

# Run diagnostics
cd ~/hope-physicians
chmod +x check-deployment.sh
./check-deployment.sh
```

**Or manually check:**

```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 status

# Check if backend is running
pm2 logs hope-physicians-backend

# Check if port 5000 is listening
sudo netstat -tuln | grep 5000
# OR
sudo ss -tuln | grep 5000

# Check Nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Check if Nginx is listening on port 80
sudo netstat -tuln | grep 80
# OR
sudo ss -tuln | grep 80

# Test backend locally
curl http://localhost:5000/api

# Test frontend locally
curl http://localhost
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Check Firewall (UFW)

```bash
# Check UFW status
sudo ufw status

# If UFW is active, allow ports
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```

---

## ✅ Step 5: Restart Services Manually

If services aren't running:

```bash
# Start backend with PM2
cd ~/hope-physicians/backend
pm2 start server.js --name "hope-physicians-backend" --update-env
pm2 save

# Start Nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx

# Check status
pm2 status
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

---

## ✅ Step 6: Re-run Deployment

If deployment didn't complete:

1. **Trigger deployment manually**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/Shubham96681/hope_physician/actions
   - Click "Deploy to EC2" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"

2. **Or push a commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment"
   git push new-origin master
   ```

---

## 🔍 Quick Diagnostic Commands

Run these on EC2 to diagnose:

```bash
# 1. Check if services are running
pm2 status
sudo systemctl status nginx

# 2. Check ports
sudo netstat -tuln | grep -E "(80|443|5000)"

# 3. Check application files
ls -la ~/hope-physicians/backend/.env
ls -la ~/hope-physicians/frontend/dist

# 4. Check logs
pm2 logs hope-physicians-backend --lines 50
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# 5. Test locally
curl http://localhost:5000/api
curl http://localhost
```

## 🎯 Most Likely Issues

### 1. **Security Group Not Configured** (90% of cases)
   - **Fix**: Add inbound rules for ports 80, 443 in EC2 Security Group

### 2. **Services Not Running**
   - **Fix**: SSH into EC2 and start services manually

### 3. **Deployment Didn't Run**
   - **Fix**: Check GitHub Actions and trigger deployment

### 4. **Firewall Blocking**
   - **Fix**: Configure UFW to allow ports 80, 443

## 📋 Checklist

- [ ] EC2 Security Group allows port 80 (HTTP)
- [ ] EC2 Security Group allows port 443 (HTTPS)
- [ ] "Deploy to EC2" workflow completed successfully
- [ ] PM2 process is running (`pm2 status`)
- [ ] Nginx is running (`sudo systemctl status nginx`)
- [ ] Port 5000 is listening (backend)
- [ ] Port 80 is listening (Nginx)
- [ ] Frontend build exists (`~/hope-physicians/frontend/dist`)
- [ ] Backend .env file exists (`~/hope-physicians/backend/.env`)

## 🚀 After Fixing

Once everything is configured:

1. **Test locally on EC2**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api
   curl http://localhost
   ```

2. **Test externally**:
   - Open browser: `http://52.66.236.157`
   - Should see your application

3. **If still not working**:
   - Check GitHub Actions logs
   - Run `check-deployment.sh` on EC2
   - Check EC2 instance status in AWS Console
