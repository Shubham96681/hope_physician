# Deployment Status Check

## 🔍 How to Check if Deployment is Running

### Step 1: Check GitHub Actions

1. **Go to Actions Tab**:
   - https://github.com/Shubham96681/hope_physician/actions

2. **Look for "Deploy to EC2" workflow**:
   - Should appear in the list
   - Click on it to see status

3. **Check Workflow Status**:
   - ✅ Green checkmark = Success
   - ⏳ Yellow circle = Running
   - ❌ Red X = Failed

### Step 2: If Workflow Didn't Run

**Option A: Trigger Manually**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Shubham96681/hope_physician/actions/workflows/deploy-ec2.yml
2. Click "Run workflow" button (top right)
3. Select branch: `master`
4. Click "Run workflow"

**Option B: Push a Commit**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment"
git push new-origin master
```

### Step 3: Check Workflow Logs

1. Click on the workflow run
2. Click on "Test, Build & Deploy" job
3. Expand each step to see logs
4. Look for errors (red text)

### Step 4: Common Issues

#### Issue: Workflow Not Triggering
- **Check**: Is branch name `master` or `main`?
- **Fix**: Push to correct branch

#### Issue: EC2 Connection Failed
- **Check**: EC2_HOST, EC2_USER, EC2_SSH_KEY secrets
- **Fix**: Verify secrets in repository settings

#### Issue: Deployment Script Failed
- **Check**: Check logs in "Execute deployment script" step
- **Fix**: See error messages in logs

#### Issue: Services Not Starting
- **Check**: PM2 and Nginx status in verification step
- **Fix**: SSH into EC2 and check manually

## 🚀 Quick Fix: Force Deployment

Run these commands to trigger deployment:

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Deployment trigger" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger deployment"
git push new-origin master
```

Or trigger manually in GitHub Actions UI.

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

Before deployment:
- [ ] All required secrets are added
- [ ] EC2 instance is running
- [ ] EC2 Security Group allows SSH (port 22)
- [ ] Branch is `master` or `main`

During deployment:
- [ ] Workflow is running in Actions tab
- [ ] No errors in workflow logs
- [ ] All steps complete successfully

After deployment:
- [ ] Check verification step output
- [ ] PM2 shows backend running
- [ ] Nginx is running
- [ ] Test application: http://your-ec2-ip

## 🔧 Manual Deployment (If CI/CD Fails)

If automated deployment fails, deploy manually:

```bash
# SSH into EC2
ssh ubuntu@your-ec2-ip

# Navigate to app directory
cd ~/hope-physicians

# Pull latest code
git pull origin master

# Run deployment
chmod +x deploy.sh
export JWT_SECRET="your-secret"
export EMAIL_USER="your-email"
export EMAIL_PASS="your-password"
# ... add other env vars
./deploy.sh
```
